You will be using a AWS provided account for this workshop. If you are logged into your personal AWS account or your corporate AWS account, you should log out now. Open this link in a new browser tab: AWS provided account Log in with your hash Click on the AWS Console button It should bring up a pop-up screen. On the pop-up, under Login Link click on Open Console You should be logged into the AWS provided account Please verify that the region selected is N. Virginia or Oregon Setup Certificate Authority Hierarchy 2. An IAM Role called CaAdminRole is the role that a CA administrator would assume. Assume the role named CaAdminRole by using switch role on the AWS console in the AWS account that you are currently logged into This role has permissions that a Certificate Authority administrator will need for CA administration. As a CA administrator you will be responsible for creating a root and subordinate certificate authority hierarchy If you are not familiar with switching roles, follow this tutorial if needed: Assume Role in Console 3. Build the infrastructure needed for creating a CA hierarchy by deploying the cloudformation template below Please download the CF template by right clicking and save link as the filename template-ca-admin.yaml CA Admin Cloudformation Stack by right clicking and saving the yaml file on your laptop. Upload and launch the cloudformation stack in the AWS account that you are logged into. If you are not familiar with this, follow instructions here by right clickking and opening link in a new browser tab Deploy Cloudformation Stack Instructions 4. Create a Root CA. Navigate to ACM Service in the AWS Console Click Get Started under Private Certificate Authority Open this link in a new browser tab for the rest of the steps : Creating a Root CA 5. Create a Subordinate Issuing CA. Navigate to ACM Service in the AWS Console Under Private CA's click on the Create CA button Open this link in a new browser tab for the rest of the steps : Creating a Subordinate CA 6. Quiz time. Open this link in a new browser tab: quiz Create Application 7. An IAM Role called AppDevRole is the role that an application developer would assume. Assume the role named AppDevRole by using switch role on the AWS console in the AWS account that you are currently logged into This role has permissions that a Application developer will need for building an web aplication which is fronted by an application load balancer and behind the load balancer is a lambda origin that provides the HTML code for a website. The application developer will also have permissions to issue a certificate under a certificate authority that they select. If you are not familiar with switching roles, follow this tutorial if needed: Assume Role in Console 8. Build the application infrastructure by deploying the cloudformation template below Please download the CF template by right clicking and save link as the filename template-appdev.yaml AppDev Cloudformation Stack by right clicking and saving the yaml file on your laptop. Upload and launch the cloudformation stack in your AWS account. If you are not familiar with this, follow instructions here by right clicking and opening link in a new browser tab Deploy Cloudformation Stack Instructions This cloudformation deployment takes about 3 minutes to complete. 9. Next step is to issue a private certificate to put on the application load balancer. Open this link in a new browser tab for steps : Issue a private certificate 10. Attach a HTTPS listener and private certificate to the ALB. Open this link in a new browser tab for steps : Attach HTTPS Listener 11. Validate the identity of the ALB with the browser that your are using. Please open link in a new browser tab For Firefox: Validate Certificate Identity on Firefox Browser For Google Chrome: Validate Certificate Identity on Chrome Browser For Microsoft Edge: Validate Certificate Identity on Microsoft Edge Browser For Google Chrome on Windows: Validate Certificate Identity on Windows 12. Quiz time. Open this link in a new browser tab: quiz 13. Cloud9 IDE environment setup Navigate to the Cloud9 service within your AWS console Open the Cloud9 IDE environment called workshop-environment . It takes about 30 seconds for the environment to start up. In the Cloud9 IDE environment you will find a folder called data-protection in the folder pane on the left side of the screen Right-click (on MacOS: control-click) the file named environment-setup.sh in the IDE and select Run This script takes about a minute to complete In the runner window below you should see SUCCESS: installed python dependencies followed by a list of the installed packages Security Monitoring: In this section we will look at how to monitor privileged actions as you build your certificate management infrastructure. We will study two scenerios. The creation of a CA Certificate and mass revocation of end entity certificates. 14. [Scenerio 1]: Monitor Mass Revocation This scenerio shows a developer revoking many end-entity certificates within a short period of time. We want to monitor and notify the security team if this type of privileged action takes place in order to investigate. 15. Create/Revoke End-Entity Certificates First we will act as the Developer by creating and then revoking many certificates at once: Mass revocation 16. Quiz time. Open this link in a new browser tab : quiz 17. Mass Revocation Alarm Setup Setup CloudWatch Alarms: Revocation Alarm setup 18. [Scenerio 2]: CA Certificate Created Creating a CA Certificate is a privileged action that should only be taken by authorized personnel within the CA Hierarchy Management team. For this reason we want to monitor the creation of any CA Certificate within our hierarchy. To do this we will setup a CloudWatch Alarm: CA Cert Alarm setup 19. Quiz time. Open this link in a new browser tab : quiz 20. Create Dashboard Now we have two alarms that have produced ALARM states. This is due to our mass revocation of multiple certificates by the application developer and the creation of a CA Certificate upon creating our CA hierarchy. Organizations can use this mechanism to build dashboards to monitor and alert (SNS, Email, etc) when sensitive actions take place. Create CloudWatch Dashboard: Create Dashboard Advanced Section : In this section we will learn about certificate extensions that can help you use certificates for applications beyond the common case of identifying TLS server endpoints. These include code signing signing Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses TLS clients for two-way (mutual) authentication What makes one certificate useful for signing code and another useful for terminating TLS are the extension fields in the certificate. Extension fields, or simply extensions, define the usage of the certificate. There are a few extensions defined in RFC 5280 that are widely commonly used and broadly supported, including Basic Constraints Key Usage Extended Key Usage In this exercise let's create a codesigning certificate using the pre-built templates provided by ACM Private CA. Follow these steps by right clicking and opening this link : Template ACM Private CA Templates allow for constrained usage of certificates for specific usecases and IAM permissions can be used to control which principals - users or roles that can issue a specific kind of certificate. Cleanup AWS Event Don't worry about cleanup, we will take care of it. Hopefully you've learned something useful in this workshop that you can take back your organization. Thank you for coming.
