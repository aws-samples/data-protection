## Identity and Access Control

These workshops deal with identity and access control as it relates to encryption and certificate management within AWS. The KMS acronym 
refers to the AWS Key Management Service. The ACM acronym refers to the AWS Certificate Manager. Some questions that we will look at during
these workshops are as follows :

* Who in your organization can administer AWS KMS keys ?
* Which application or user can use AWS KMS keys to encrypt and decrypt data ?
* Which group of people in your organization can revoke ACM Certificates ?
* How does separation of duties work with respect to encryption key management and certificates management ?

The below workshops will added to this repo as they become available
